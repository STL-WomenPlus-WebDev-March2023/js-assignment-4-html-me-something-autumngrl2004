      <p class = "music">The #1 spot goes to Northwest's finest, Ryan Caraveo. Ryan Caraveo
         has many different sounds. His more recent albums consist of an 
         alternative / pop sound, while his older songs are hip hop. I can't 
         say he has any songs that i truly dislike, but I <b>love</b> almost all of 
         them. Along with thinking he creates catchy music that I can vibe 
         with; I think he is a talented lyricist as well. </p>

      <p id="more_info">
         A 30 year old melodic rapper from seattle, most of his older songs have to do 
         with his drive to succeed with the cards he was dealt in life, dealing with 
         and overcoming depression, relationship issues, and a feeling of always needing
         to be better stemmed from not feeling content with himself. I started listening 
         to him and immediately related to alot of the details he put in his songs and 
         started listening to more. I can appreciate alot of different genres, but I usually 
         get hooked to a song because of the words and instruments. I think I naturally appreciate
         songs more when the artists delicatelly put the words in place because I have such
         hard time doing so and really feeling like i'm saying what I really wanted to put out there. 
         Through the years, like every artist, their style changes with their growth (not always for the better), and so did his. His music mainly changed to a more
         pop/ electronic and melodic sound, mainly talking about not being in the same mental 
         place he was, some relationship songs, and a cover of Avril Lavigne's "Complicated" w/ DJ Aoki that's 
         not the same as the original but definitely a great upbeat version.
