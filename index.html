      <h1>My Top 5 Favorite Artists!</h1>
      <p>Music has always been a big part of my life. Music has comforted me, motivated me,
         excited me, always keeps me singing like a fool in my car, and has played a part in
         so many bonds and memories. Everyone has those Artists that stick around through
         time and speak to their soul, here's my top 5. </p>

      <p>The #1 spot goes to Northwest's finest, Ryan Caraveo. Ryan Caraveo
         has many different sounds. His more recent albums consist of an 
         alternative / pop sound, while his older songs are hip hop. I can't 
         say he has any songs that i truly dislike, but I love almost all of 
         them. Along with thinking he creates catchy music that I can vibe 
         with; I think he is a talented lyricist and I can truly relate to his lyrics. </p>
